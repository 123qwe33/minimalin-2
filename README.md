# minimalin 2

![banner](design/store/marketing-banner.png)

Minimalin 2 is a fork of the original Minimalin with minimal changes made to keep it working, as Rawgit, where the original config page was hosted, has since shut down.

Minimalin is a fully customizable watchface that blends analog and digital for a modern and elegant look. <br><br>
Minimalin uses Nupe, a custom font with numbers and icons, optimized with bitmap mapping to perfectly fit the pixel grid of the Pebble watch.

Some key features of Minimalin:
* Fully configurable colors
* Weather conditions and temperature
* Date display
* Steps from Pebble Health
* Low battery icon
* Bluetooth disconnected icon (pick your favorite)
* Rainbow hand :rainbow:
